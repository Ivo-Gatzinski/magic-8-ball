# Magic 8 Ball

## Description

- We couldn't decide what app to build, so we built an app to make the decision for us.

- What to do? - Modern life is uncertain but pressures us into stressful decisions. Let us take the responsibility off your shoulders!

- The user asks a question and the app generates a random answer to help them come to a decision, while also finding something else to blame.

## Installation

1. Run `npm i`.
2. You will need an existing MySQL database.
3. Create `.env` file with MySQL credentials for local development and a SECRET. Refer to [.env.EXAMPLE](./.env.EXAMPLE)
4. Run `npm start` to start the app.
