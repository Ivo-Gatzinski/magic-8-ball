## Description

- We couldn't decide what app to build, so we built an app to make the decision for us.

- What to do? - Modern life is uncertain but pressures us into stressful decisions. Let us take the responsibility off your shoulders!

- The user asks a question and the app generates a random answer to help them come to a decision, while also finding something else to blame.
